Hello and welcome to #TeamJB

Many of you may know my story but for those who don’t, I’d like to share. My life used to be as normal as any other 45 year old working man . I worked everyday, 50-60 hours a week providing for my wife and children.  However, life sometimes throws you a curve. Everything around me seemed to change when I found out that I was diagnosed with Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which is Head and Neck Cancer. I have faced many hardships during my life but nothing like this.  I went to several doctor appointments to find a specialist and to run several tests like CT scans, MRI’s, and blood tests.  My reports came back and several lymph nodes were positive, so now I am preparing for chemo treatments for the next few months.  These treatments will take me out of work and unable to provide for my family.

These treatments are very expensive and also consisted of getting a  procedure done that included getting a port placed in my chest for all the medicine and blood work to be placed in. Not only will the chemo treatments be expensive, my insurance will not cover additional tests I may need. Providing for my family is really important to me, and sometimes I need to swallow my pride, so I am asking for YOUR help! My wife is already on disability and all the mounting doctor bills will has forced us to ask for assistance.  I have worked hard to get where I am and soon will be danger of losing everything as the expenses mount and I battle this disease they call CANCER.

Many of you have asked me what you can do to help, and now I am asking you for your help with raising donations. I need to raise $7,000 to assist with my medical bills and living costs.   I asking out of the goodness of your heart to donate however much you can, and if you can’t donate please help me by spreading the word and sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, or texts. I’m going to keep fighting and now I need you on my team to help me fight this thing as well!

GOD BLESS YOU ALL
