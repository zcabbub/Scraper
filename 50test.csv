We had our pictures taken for the special report covering the Lismore Flood of 2017, the worst disaster in in the regional city's recent history. But that was really just the beginning.Where can I start? Before the flood hit, she had already suffered a back injury, with three inflamed discs in her lower lumbar, so I picked up the slack at her cafe as a result. But when the flood hit, we had lost everything. Our cafe was completely destroyed, but our house was also affected by it. Where do we go from that?Our insurance claim with NRMA was initially rejected (it's currently being reviewed again, thanks to social media pressure). But then came the hospitalisation and numerous medical emergencies — adult croup, returning migraines, hospitalised children, tachycardia, ongoing chronic pain from the back injury — which have have taken their toll, not only on what money we don't have, but psychologically as well. Where do we turn to?The last straw came today when we discovered her tooth had broken. On top of everything else that has happened, this one is the proverbial straw on the camel's back. Now we're facing the prospect of expensive surgery, and we have nowhere to turn to. I'm putting this campaign out there because I have nowhere else to turn to.Everything that could go wrong, pretty much has. The stress, the grief over the loss of our cafe, the complete financial disaster that has come due to our insurance rejection, and the strain that this has put on our family, our marriage, our health ...The goal of $5000 will help her get the surgery she needs.That will get us going.If by a miracle we could raise the odd $90k in outstanding debts, that would be the best thing in the world for us, and we'd at least be able to work towards getting all of her other medical conditions in check. But we're happy with just enough to get her teeth looked at.The cover photo for this campaign is a picture from the Daily Telegraph's coverage of the Lismore floods, and the two people are Kate and myself.

I was in the final year of my studies, working towards the end of my PhD, when I had to put it aside to run the cafe.

I along with three other students (Mahmoud Bouad, Juan Manzo, Andrea Ramos) from Westminster College (Fulton, MO) are traveling to Guatemala this summer for a service trip. We won the Project for Peace award, a prestigious grant that is awarded to students from Universities and Colleges that are a part of the Davis United World College Scholars partner school. The grant is for the purpose of conflict prevention and resolution. Our Project focuses on building a rainwater collection system in a school called Escuela Oficial Rural Mixta Alberto Zarco
 in the small town of Caserio Los Guates, San Juan Sacatepequez, Guatemala. The area suffers from water scarcity, which sometimes causes conflict among its multiethnic community. By addressing the issue of water scarcity at the school we hope to reduce tensions among students and try and bring the community together.  

We are working with a company called Cassa (to learn more) ,  that specializes in building sustainable homes, which are equipped with solar panels and rainwater collection systems. While our grant covers the cost of building the system that will harvest rainwater, the proposed size of the collection tank(3x3.5x1.6 m) 
is too small to address the needs of a school of 500 students. We are therefore asking for donations of any amount that will assist in funding this project. Your donations will assist in the building and maintenance of this water catchment system. Every donation, no matter the amount will make a difference, in helping us improve the lives of these kids. You can learn more about our project here . If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. Thank you.

If you follow my Instagram and Facebook pages, you&#039;ll be up to date with everything I&#039;ve been doing at The Florence Academy of Art. If not, then I&#039;m here to fill you in! \n\nMy second apology is for the postcard sketches that were meant to be sent from Florence. My extreme perfectionist tendencies, combined with a 9am to 7pm workday at the academy (and more work on most of the weekends), made it almost impossible for me to complete the dozens of sketches I needed to complete to the high standard I demand of myself. To make up for my failing, I am working on turning one of my favourite sketches from the school year into a limited edition print, of which you will all receive one, signed, dated and numbered. The one I am choosing is the most similar to what I envisioned doing on the postcards. \n\nMy family has also gone through a major bereavement in the last year - the loss of my Grandfather, who I grew up with in the same house my whole life, which has made everything a lot harder for me. I&#039;m immensely grateful for your support and will never forget what you&#039;ve all done for me, helping me achieve my dream of studying with the most skillful drawing and painting teachers in the world. \n\nThe year was everything I dreamed it would be and more. I was accelerated to the Second Year program after only one term, and won The Graeme Hildebrand Emerging Artist Award in Melbourne, a work-study scholarship from school - I&#039;ll be a studio assistant in winter trimester next year in exchange for lower tuition fees, and was awarded &quot;Best Cast Drawing of Second Year&quot;! My report cards also revealed perfect scores of 15/15 two of the three trimesters (14.5/15 for the first trimester!).\n\nEnjoy a few photos below, remember to follow my Instagram and/or Facebook page, and I will check back here to inform you of the completion of the limited edition print!

On May 10th I will never be able to forget because it's my birthday they told us my brother has cancer in his pelvic region. There was not a hospital around here that could do the surgery he requires. So we were told about MD Anderson in Houston Texas and that's. where we went.  He has 5 surgeons because this is a very extensive surgery. They will be removing part of his right leg and pelvic area. His kidneys and colon must be rerouted. There are several organs involved. My mother has been with him since day one and I will be flying out Sunday to stay for a few weeks. These trips are astronomical. Having to pay travel expenses, a room, food, washing our laundry this all adds up very fast.

13,2020-10-23,https://www.gofundme.com/f/tenleys-medical-expenses,Tenley And Piper's Medical Expenses,"Medical, Illness & Healing",https://www.gofundme.com/discover/medical-fundraiser,50000,5826,$,"To My dear friends and family,As many already know, the last 9 months have been a constant medical battle for my best friend, since childhood, Susan Kravitz Hopper’s granddaughter, Tenley.   Tenley has been diagnosed with a very rare condition called CRMO- Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis.  CRMO is a very rare 1 in 1 million diagnosis. It is a genetic auto-inflammatory disease with no cure or standard treatment. Each case is individual, and each person is different. Lesions form in the bones and through the marrow. She has had numerous MRI’s and different medications. Unfortunately, this disease has had very little research done because of its rarity. The duration and treatment of this disease is unknown. It could take several years but we pray that Tenley will go into remission. Inside, her little body is fighting an incredible battle. Her inflammation levels can sky rocket at any time. With that comes excruciating pain that most adults would find intolerable. While on the outside Tenley seems like a healthy child, she is not. She tries to stay positive and do the things that she always did in between her bouts of pain, but her energy level is not what is was. The funds raised from this campaign will be used to offset some of the continued medical expenses for Tenley’s medical care and will also be used toward her travel expenses to the University of Iowa Children’s Hospital to be seen by a CRMO specialist twice a year. This last year has brought this diagnosis to their world that no one could ever imagine.  While her mother, who is a single mom of 2 has a good job and insurance, that has provided her basic needs for her family, it has caused a large financial burden. Large co-pays, lost time of work for doctor’s appointments, providing things like a wheelchair, installing bathroom apparatus to make it easier for Tenley to maneuver around, and travel expenses to her rheumatologist in Gainesville, Florida and Iowa City, Iowa. Right now, Tenley can only walk with crutches so she primarily gets around in her wheelchair. The family does not know all to expect, however they know there will be a life time of expenses, more pain, spreading of the disease and she will become totally crippled without ongoing treatment.   Her family has helped her as much as they can, but cannot afford the ongoing treatment. In 3 weeks she will be begin infusion.  This consists of three consecutive days of treatment, each infusion lasting four hours.  Tenley is to have this done every 3 months for the next year.  Because the hospital is not close to home, this will require lodging for the days that Tenley needs to be there. Any donations will be greatly appreciated. Kirsten (Tenley’s and Piper's Mom) has always been the first one to come to someone’s aid when needed.  She never asks anyone for help. I am asking for her. If you cannot give please pray for her and share this on your page.https://www.facebook.com/TenleysCRMOJourney/https://www.facebook.com/groups/299570590469012/Thank you.Jeanne",2017-06-01,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Jeanne Childress', 'Beneficiary': 'kirsten lamarre', 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Germantown, TN'}",5,1,61,56,0,0,59,276,"{0: {'Author': 'Jeanne Childress', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Unfortunately Tenley&#039;s sister Piper has also been diagnosed with CRMO as well.

After taking Toradol (pain medication) for several days, there was still no change in her pain level. Her doctor in Gainesville is out of town, but the Doctor in charge of his patients during his absence (Dr Melissa Elder) decided to have her come in to the infusion room to get some IV fluids, IV Toradol (Pain Medication) as well as Solu-Medrol (Steroid). Dr. Elder decided to admit her, in order to give more doses of the medication and also to get 3 more MRI’s done. Due to the pain in her back, they are going to do a dedicated MRI of her spine, with and without contrast, MRI of her right knee, with and without contrast, as well as a repeat MRI of her left Ankle and Foot, with and without contrast. These studies were ordered STAT last night, but the tests were not able to be done. There’s apparently a back-up in MRI due to their machine going down earlier in the week and them only having one machine at this hospital. They need a 5 hour window of time in order to complete all 3 exams, so the goal is to bring her in late tonight. Pending the results of these exams, will determine when we will get to leave the hospital. We are really hoping that the MRI’s will be done tonight and then they can discharge her tomorrow. (Finger’s Crossed) I will post an update after the MRI results are in. As always, thank you so much for all of your support! We love and appreciate all of you!!!

Since then he has undergone 5 surgeries, the last while he was awake. In February 2017 a MRI showed that Sean's tumor had grown back to its original size. He is currently receiving chemo for 21 days straight with a 7 day break (he is on his third round) and his last MRI showed the tumor had no change in size. His current Dr. wants to attempt another surgery consisting of a partial tumor removal and burn. Sean is hoping to go another route. He recently had an appointment with Dr. Burzynski, his clinic specializes in cancer therapy, utilizing an understanding of each patient’s genetic make-up to unravel the biology of their cancer and identify effective treatment strategies using targeted therapies that are aimed at specific genes or proteins that are found only in cancer cells or their environment.

She suffered a Spinal Cord Infarct meaning the flow of blood to her spinal cord was cut off, despite much investigation the cause of the infarct remains unknown.As a result she has been left paralysed from the waist down and now uses a wheelchair for mobility.Prior to her injury Julie was a bit of a gym junkie, arriving at the gym by 5am most mornings for a workout. One of her favourite machines to use was the cross trainer so when she came across the EasyStand Glider which retails at $14,000 AUS she was thrilled that such a machine existed for people suffering from paralysis.This machine will enable her to keep free movement in all her joints, allow her to achieve a good cardiovascular workout which can be a real challenge from a wheelchair, help with digestion, allow her to bear weight on her legs and possibly decrease loss of bone density, but the best part of all is that it will allow her to stand.With Julie not working now and the major financial burden this has put on the family with costs such as installing new wheelchair accessible kitchens, bathrooms, cars and ongoing medical treatment whilst raising a young family.... I am reaching out to you all to please donate what you can.  something so small could mean so much for Julie so we can reach the $5000 mark and get Julie up and getting some of those exercise endorphins she has been  missing terribly.  SO please please if you can help it would be so much appreciated.

Ollie is only 15 weeks old and is an adored member of their family.  The couple is devastated by this loss and will do anything to get their sweet girl back. Please help to get Ollie back home by raising money for a reward. Your timely donation will make a profound difference in their ability to reclaim her before anything bad happens to her.  Often times dogs of Ollie's breed are stolen to be used as bait dogs in dog fighting operations. We don't know for certain if this is what happened to her but that's why it's so heartbreakingly important to get Ollie back to Jeff and Kristyona. In the unfortunate event that Ollie doesn't get returned, the money raised here will go towards an alarm system for the couple's newly purchased home. This is the second break-in since they moved in November 2016. Thank you thank you thank you for your contribution! See the news clip here: http://q13fox.com/2017/05/31/heartless-burglar-in-milton-steals-new-15-week-old-puppy-from-womans-home/See what a loved and sweet sweet pup she is here:",2017-06-01,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Ashley Cook', 'Beneficiary': 'Kristyona Rosin', 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'South Royalton, VT'}",5,0,20,20,0,0,22,93,"{0: {'Author': 'Ashley Cook', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Hey everyone!\r\nOllie has been safely returned home unharmed and has been livin up her summer back with Jeff and Kristyona.

A few weeks ago Marion found herself up at Joondalup Hospital for what she thought was a merely a painful tummy ache. The next few days brought some really shit news........Marion was diagnosed with Bowel cancer and needed immediate surgery. Surgery went well and although in a lot of pain she was feeling relieved it was out!!!! But that bastard we call cancer wasn't going to make it that easy. A scan revealed the cancer had spread to her liver. The cancer in Marion's liver is inoperable as it is in too many areas of the liver and a transplant is not an option. Doctors have said they can blast it with Chemo to slow it down and buy her time. How long is unknown - but there is no cure!!!!Marion, hubby Ian and their two children; Stefan (25) and Tehya (7) are in shock, disbelief and in absolute fear of what their future holds.As conventional medicine isn't offering Marion much hope, she is looking into other options overseas and having some alternative treatments here in Perth too. As alternative medicine and treatments are not covered by Medicare or private health insurance, it leaves Marion and her family running out of money......fast!!! The scan to confirm the cancer had spread to her liver cost them $900 alone.Ian has been off work since this all started and while his wife is still recovering from surgery and trying to cope with such deviating news, he wants to be home by her side as long as their finances allow.So I am here on behalf Ian, Stefan, Tehya and all of us who love Marion to ask for help from our beautiful community. Please help us, help Marion fight this bastard as hard as she can in every way possible.

All of my outside endeavors have been toward the raising of funds to go on this journey, where I will be seeking to learn, to listen and to remember.My life and all the work I have answered the call to invest my existence in is related to a deep process of re-membering, decolonizing and re-indigenizing self in connection to all others. This trip is a very important part of elevating my ability to continue doing this work in a more intentional and knowledgable way. Look to my website for more: www.janalynnecreativeproductions.comI will be traveling to the Philippines between the days of June 24- July 18, where I will be investing time and finances on the deepening of my knowledge of ancestral teachings received from teachers who have come into my life and also the teacher of Motherland herself, her soil, her waters, her air, her radiant sunlight.I begin my trip in Luzon traveling the Cordelieras and through my home province in Ilocos with a good friend and teacher who has been planning this time with me since last year to commune with the land. Then I travel to Pamati, with the Tao Foundation to listen to the teachings of Elders who have walked the path of tradition in living out roles connected to spirit and ancestral practices of healing. Located at the Sakahang Lilok Organic Farm.To close I will be going to Palawan to be reunited with my teacher of Inner Dance and sister of light Serena Olsen at Bahay Kalipay and work with her and Pi Villaraza to deepen my knowledge of the Energy Work connected to Inner Dance. Your contribution would be supporting my ability to give offering to my teachers, would help with travel within the Philippines, and living expenses that would allow me to live one month away from the United States so I can better serve on my return. I would like to offer in exchange- Illustrations that I will be creating on my trip, as well as prayers that will be created in connection to those illustrations. I will be creating a 4 part series that will be connected with uncovered learnings.$125 Donation: All 4 Prints with Coupled Prayers that reveal the lessons of my journeys$100 Donation: 2 Prints with Coupled Prayers that reveal the lessons of my journeys$50 Donation: 1 Print with a Coupled Prayer that reveal a lesson from my journeys $25 Donation: 1 post card Sized Print with a Coupled Prayer that reveal a lesson from my journeysAll Contributors of any amount whether it be $1 or $1000 will receive an online shoutout, in the form of a prayer written by me in reflection of my connection to you.I hope you can support on the continuation of this journey. Agyamanak,Jana Lynne Umipig",2017-06-01,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Jana Lynne Umipig', 'Beneficiary': None, 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Bronx, NY'}",9,0,86,85,0,0,86,150,"{0: {'Author': 'Jana Lynne Umipig', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'To all the Supporters of my Journey!

The goal is simple, provide a site that will not only raise awareness for many mental health issues but offer outlets and solutions for those that are seeking it. Anxiety, depression, and suicide are real issues facing everyone in today's world. Donations will help us nurture an organization that will have three initial focal points. 1. Bring the happy! The site, foundation, and message will ALWAYS be positive and uplifting. 2. Help people find answers and support for their personal struggles. 3. Continue Karrin's amazing spirit and compassion by linking people to causes, needs, and issues they can impact, follow and support.100% of donations will assist in starting and growing this Foundation. The start will be small. However, the hope is to grow into a full blown, non-profit organization that will promote and facilitate HAPPY while connecting people with support groups, discussion pages, hotlines, counseling, therapy options, and doctors. Also giving contributions back to society in arenas that are positive influences on people, the environment and the world. I set the goal as a small amount but the sky is the limit.

I am a student at the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, studying viola performance. I have been playing viola for about ten years of my life now. It is my passion, I cannot imagine doing anything else with my life. My dream job is to be in a professional orchestra and teaching private lessons. I would not only love to play, but I would also love to share my passion by teaching other people how to play. However, there are a few barriers that I have to get over before I can achieve these goals. I have been practicing several hours a day, bettering myself as a musician, and plan on doing so until I achieve these goals. In addition to  this, another huge aspect to playing an instrument professionally is what instrument you play on. Professional orchestras are not only accepting you, the player, but they are also accepting the instrument. The instrument that the professional plays on has to fit in with the rest of the section. These instruments typically run from $15,000 to $20,000 due to better sound quality, how the instrument is made, and what materials make up the instrument. I have been playing on the same instrument now for about 3 years. Itis a very reliable instrument for an intermediate student, and has been a great instrument for getting me into college. However, I am now at the point where I need to start looking into moving on to the next step and buying a professional viola. I will start taking auditions for professional jobs in about two years. In this amount of time, I need to obtain a professional viola and become comfortable playing on it. The latter step is a very important aspect in this journey. If I become comfortable playing on my instrument, then I will be able to obtain a job. The funds from this campaign will help me purchase a professional, quality viola. I would not be able to afford such an instrument without a campaign such as this. Obtaining these funds and purchasing a viola would mean that I would be able to accomplish my dreams as a professional violist. I would strive to better myself every single day and share my joy and love for music with other people, everywhere I go. I would be extremely grateful for all the help and support. Thank You So Much!Hannah MacNeal",2017-06-01,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Hannah Macneal', 'Beneficiary': None, 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Louisville, KY'}",12,0,30,30,0,0,31,307,"{0: {'Author': 'Hannah MacNeal', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Happy Weekend Everyone!\r\nI have a posted  new video updating everyone on the status of my new viola search and process. \r\nThank you guys for the support and kindness!\r\nPlease like, share, or donate!', 'Photos': ['https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pb85rbtezHo/0.jpg'], 'Created_at': '2017-10-20T11:03:46-05:00'}, 1: {'Author': 'Hannah MacNeal', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Hello my fellow music lovers!\r\nI hope everyone&#039;s school year is starting off with a bang!

It never occurred to me that he will get this awful disease as he has been on a vegan diet most of his life. Five years ago, he had a high PSA reading of 25. He carried on with his life, ignored that it could be a threat to his life. Until, in September 2015, things got worse. He was admitted to hospital for a serious kidney failure. He had to be put on a drip for two days and within that short time his kidney recovered miraculously. Leaving the hospital with a very high PSA reading of 2000, we knew we had to do something about his prostate problem. He refused all conventional western medicine like chemo, radiation therapy, biopsy etc. Instead we decided to seek an alternative treatment. We have tried CBD cannabis oil and certain diet like the Budwig protocol. All seemed very promising but in reality he lost time trying to achieve a cure. Now with his soaring PSA of 8000 and the cancer has metastasised, we are feeling desperate for a miracle. He is losing more and more weight. He is now basically skin and bones.            We searched the internet again for a good alternative treatment. We have come across Dr. Song’s 3D Targeted Prostate Cure which is only available in China and is the only one in the world. Men all over the world would travel to China to get their prostate problems fix once and for all! All information is on the webpage (http://www.3dprostatecure.com). Dr. Song’s unique strategy and approach is not just any alternative treatment but is a science and traditional medicine based. Anyone who knows ‘hands-on’ about Dr. Song and his clinic in China is very much welcome to share their experience.             Francis is travelling to China on his own on the 4th of June  with a great hope that his metastatic cancer can be cured. I am totally distraught by the thought that I might never see him again. I wish I could come with him so I can give him my full support but there is no one who could look after my young children. My family are in the Philippines. The cost of $28,000 is too great for our budget.  Your donation will cover basic expenses, his medical treatment cost and will pay for our debts. Your help is very much appreciated. For anyone contributing towards this cost, I can at least offer a running report over the next six weeks. Please leave your e-mail address. If this treatment, is as effective as promised there will be many men who would be interested in the outcome.            Francis has lived a frugal life. He is not into ownership of worldly goods, not high on wish list. His only wish right now is to be normal again. I guess he never anticipated this to happen.  He is such a fair man, never thinks of himself alone and above all he never ask anyone for anything. I am posting this campaign in his absence as he would not agree in seeking financial help.  He also has a good sense of humour that even when his in excruciating pain he still managed to crack jokes. What a brave man! He is not frightened of dying but the thought of leaving his loved ones inevitably reduces him to tears.  I would regret to see him go. Words are not enough to express my gratitude for the things he has done for me. He lifted me out of poverty. He helped me established a decent life in Australia. At one point he raised some money for people who were badly affected by a devastating typhoon that hit Philippines five years ago. Ralf V. Emmerson coined the motto “Live, let live and help live.” He was such a humanitarian!            With your contribution, I may be able to pay him back for his good deeds. Your generosity may give him the chance to see his children grow up.             Thank you for reading this long post, and may the powers to be protect and care for you too in any situation of desperate circumstance.Lot’s of love,Reslyn Rae￼",2017-06-01,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Rose Lynn Rae', 'Beneficiary': None, 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Castlemaine, VIC'}",7,0,35,25,0,0,28,202,"{0: {'Author': 'Reslyn Rae', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Francis is getting better every day with treatment', 'Photos': ['https://d2kw0licpa1moo.cloudfront.net/20840282_14994042930_updates.jpg', 'https://d2kw0licpa1moo.cloudfront.net/20840282_14994043630_updates.jpg', 'https://d2kw0licpa1moo.cloudfront.net/20840282_14994046560_updates.jpg'], 'Created_at': '2017-07-07T00:17:55-05:00'}, 1: {'Author': 'Reslyn Rae', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'VERDICT: ITS CURED, but we urgently need $5,000 more for him to be able to come back to Australia.\n\nThe full story plus photos to follow soon...', 'Photos': [], 'Created_at': '2017-07-05T09:26:02-05:00'}, 2: {'Author': 'Reslyn Rae', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Cachexia is a devastating form of muscle wasting that is often the final stage of cancer.

New Balance Nationals is one of the largest and most important track meets in the U.S.A. The team will be competing in an event we have only participated in once. We have now become even faster and believe our chances at winning are even higher. We have not been able to run the event again due to an abundance of injuries. But we were strong enough to run a time that has now ranked us #15 in the country.  Even through the injuries athelete's have stepped up and improved drastically to keep the team functioning. Khalid Armstrong, Joshua Zincke, Jason Perlaza, and Spencer Seide have also been able to qualify for another event which is the 4x400 meter relay. D'shaun Ricketts has also qualified for his very own event, the hammer throw, where he will be competing against almost 100 other athletes to become U.S.A National Champion. Tyrese Moore will also be attending to run with Jason Perlaza, Spencer Seide and Joshua Zincke as we compete to move up the rankings from U.S #15 to U.S #1.Our team has overcome many obstacles, from injuries to trying to fundraise money to compete, and travel to these high level competitions. We have trained extremely hard and even stay after normal practice hours to make sure we are at peak condition. But as we put our focus towards fundraising it can sometimes get in the way of our practice. If we reach our goal and raise more than enough money, that extra money will go to the next year MVHS Track and Field National Qualifiers so they can stay focused on their training and not have to worry about financial issues. So we please ask you to support us and donate anything you can, as we start our journey at becoming National Champions and bringing this great honor back to our community.",2017-06-02,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Jason Perlaza', 'Beneficiary': 'Amado Lambert', 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Mount Vernon, NY'}",10,6,37,34,0,0,36,131,"{0: {'Author': 'Amado Lambert', 'Author type': 'BENEFICIARY', 'Text': 'We appreciate your support in 2017 and now hoping for your help towards the  2018 New Balance High School National Championships. \n\nI&#039;m very proud to coach this group of young men from Mount Vernon High School.

A time since launching their campaign a month ago. \n\nThey realized their peers lack the resources to make crowd funding a winning option for them so they asked me to appeal to established grown folk who may give them a shot at their goal. Note that apart from the gofundme campaign, the team raised just under $1900 pounding the pavement. Five-hundred ($500) of which was already spent on entry fees.\n\nAs a result of Regents exams into Thursday afternoon, we must fly early Friday morning in order to race in the 800M SMR as scheduled at 5:05pm on Friday afternoon. The 4x4 team races on Sunday at 1:30pm. A return flight home is essential since athletes from Thornton campus graduate on 6/18, as well as, Regents exams resuming on 6/18 through 6/22.\n\nIndoor Nationals is easy since its hosted in NYC even though student-athletes cover the entry fees. Outdoor Nationals is more of a challenge. Mount Vernon City School District does not cover the costs for meets contested beyond New York State Championships. Flights to Greensboro, NC and lodging are now expensive since its National Championship Weekend and everything is at a premium.\n\nThis delegation includes three coaches plus Spencer Seide, Jonathan Adams and Daijon Richards who will return for 2018-2019. Our rising college freshman are Khalid Armstrong headed to UAlbany, Joshua Zincke to UBuffalo and Joshwa Powell who is weighing options including Northern Vermont U.\n\nDonor support is the predominant source of funding for high school /youth sports teams to travel and participate in prestigious sporting events. An additional $3000 through this gofundme campaign will enable us to reach our goal.\n\nPlease follow the link below. No gift is too great or too small.

36,2020-10-23,https://www.gofundme.com/f/teds-book-the-mission-higher,Ted's Book: The Mission Higher,"Creative Arts, Music & Film",https://www.gofundme.com/discover/creative-fundraiser,4500,4630,$,"Please help my book become a reality.  I believe it is a worthy story to be told about a real man, and his journey in a changing city to becoming an icon at Mission High, and in San Francisco.In 2007, I began writing a screenplay in earnest.  I was unemployed, and I ran a story idea past Jack Kelly,  who said, ""It's good, but you have to 'do it!'"".Well, I did it, and actually got enough positive feedback to keep the dream alive.  Arriving in Madison in 2009, I decided to convert the project to prose.In movie terms, the story pans out to about to an hour and twenty minutes.  In conversion, the story is a novella.  Try as I might, I am not given to flowery prose.The story is about race relations, and about San Francisco's vibrant, diverse neighborhoods.  It takes place in the late 1950's, when race gangs were prevelant, but also takes into account complexities arising from Labor uprisings in the 1930's.There is a football team, a neighborhood bar, Mission High, the waterfront, and San Francisco, itself, all vying for central character.   Inside these are a wide array of characters who seem to add equally to the final narrative, just as in life.I am proud of this work as a love letter to a city that no longer exists.  I hope that it gives generations of San Franciscans a context for loving their city, and knowing where it comes from.  I am trying to introduce it to the curriculum of the San Francisco high schools.I found a publisher that specializes in new authors.  They will edit the work.  They will help and guide the cover artwork, digitization, platforming, licensing, distribution, ISDM, a radio interview and publicity campaign, as well as a few print copies.These print copies I will reserve for the top 35 donations.My committment to them contactually is around 3,000 dollars, and that is the minimum I need to raise.  Additional to that, I would hope to have enough for a book tour.  Optimally to New York and other cities, but especially, at least, to San Francisco for signings, interviews and sales.I will use anything above the 3,000 for this purpose.Thank You for reading this, and hopefully for contributing to the most important thing I have ever endeavored to do.Here is a sample chapter: CHAPTER 1                                      IMPOSSIBLY BRIGHT The afternoon sun sits high above the wide old cobblestone street.  It is partially paved, laced with railroad tracks, bounded by houses on one side and a block long corrugated metal structure on the other.  Today, there are bluebird skies and not a whisper of a breeze. This is San Francisco, an impossibly bright early September San Francisco in 1957.  Ernie McNealy, a tallish, athletically built black man is walking down the sidewalk of an industrial section in the Mission district.  It is hot and, wearing a dark brown sports shirt with long pants, he must be feeling the heat.  Mac stops and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.  Peering up to the corner he sees an obscure wooden sign reading “Deer Inn”.  Placing one hand on his hip, he straightens back and looks the length of the imposing structure across the street.  On it there are tall black painted letters that read “Republic Steel”.  Then, he looks back at the bar’s location across the street. McNealy muses to himself, “Anyone can get a drink at a ‘union’ bar…anyone ‘union’.”  During this time of day the bar would be filled with retired and off shift steel workers, longshoremen, and assorted tradesmen from this multi-racial working-class neighborhood.  These were men who had forged friendships in mutual support during labor strikes as far back as ‘Bloody Thursday’ and the General Strike in 1934; struggles that have long since crystallized San Francisco’s reputation as a “union town”. As he approaches the simple wooden corner building, the pavement gives way in a steep slope, dipping almost a half-story beneath an overhang. There, in the welcome shade, is a worn swinging door.  McNealy extends his hand to push and ducks in.CHAPTER 2DEER INN Pushing through the door, McNealy stands in blackness, unable to see.  He instinctively holds his hand up like a visor, stoops a bit and steps forward as the door closes behind him.  “Sheww!” he exhales. Out of the darkness, a bright voice chimes in, “Heyy, what’s shakin’ Coach?” “Hot!” comes his reply, as he pulls and flaps his shirt for air.  The sound of a fan grows and fades as a slight breeze rushes across his face. A different voice, abrupt and with a slight brogue speaks, “You should change those damn colors!  I never liked ‘em.” More voices from around the room add: “Ahhhh!” derisively.  ”Brown and gold…that’s Mission!” comes another from nearby. And from the back someone demands, “Siddown!” A thin voice with a Russian accent offers, “Maybe if you had taken the time to participate…” “Kolov!?  Who woke you up?” retorts the brogue, “Don’t you know?  I was preserving my body.  I’m a machine!” There are yet more cat calls from many voices. Kolov continues, “Nooo, no, no, you boys.  It is true!  He has been working his switch every day for the last 35 years!” The place erupts in laughter. His eyes now adjusting to the darkness, Mac finally draws down his hand and takes in the bar.  It is an old Victorian place.  There is a small wood paneled room, a second room with tables, and a kitchen with the light off.  Interspersed with pictures of local football and baseball heroes are oil paintings of bare breasted women with bouffant hair styles. Seated between the doors to the kitchen, the cigarette smoke, and the extra room is a bent hawkish old man from where the Russian voice has been coming.  There is a rainbow of ethnic faces sitting and standing about the rest of the room.   Coach McNealy approaches the near end of the bar.  In accordance with an old San Francisco tradition dating back to the Gold Rush, there are no stools at the bar.  He addresses the bartender, who is dressed in a white short-sleeve button down shirt and a black tie tucked into a white apron tied about his waist. “You have a soda pop of some kind?” he queries. “Yessir,  I got Coke and…err…ahhh…” responds the bartender leaning back and looking down, then opening a refrigerator door, “Coke.”. “Coke is fine, thanks” says McNealy with a smile. From the end of the bar comes the brogue from a short, stout red headed man wearing suspenders.  This is Terry Guillory.  “So rumor has it you’re recruitin’ kids from all over the city for the JV’s this year.” Again, there is a hubbub, as the denizens of the bar react to the words.  The Coach sets his Coke on the broad mahogany bar and waits.  As the commotion begins to fade, he starts to speak slowly, evenly, lifting his eyes to the room. “Well now, gentlemen, that’s wrong.”  Pausing for effect, Mac gestures in a southerly direction, “Fact is, I’ve been recruiting down there in Daly City, too!”  There is laughter from around the bar. He continues, raising his hand for silence, “I guess you all know I’m new around here, so I’ll be clear.  I’m looking for kids who want to commit to our whole football program at Mission High.  Coach Olivier (O-liv-ee-yay) and I want to build a winning program for years to come.  But I can guarantee you this: no matter who comes in from outside, if your kids go to class, show up to practice with their heads on right, and work hard- they will get to play football on this team…and other schools are going to know we came to play.” Coach McNealy ends as calmly as he had begun, but firmly.  Around the bar, men raise their glasses, and there is a general nodding and agreement.  The red headed man engages McNealy’s eyes, nods and raises his glass. A skinny, brown skinned man named Sandoval, wearing a cast and seated against the wall with his leg up on another chair leans forward and impulsively swings his cane, only nearly missing people and beers. “See, I told you he was going to be alright!  All of you were ready to sell this guy right down the river.  You too Ju-u-u-neee!” he finishes; now pointing his cane at a stout, middle-aged black man. “Awww, why you callin’ me out?” the man pleads, putting down his glass on a nearby table. Another black man, Avery Parker, about the same age, tall, sinewy and strong looking speaks over the top of his beer, about to take a sip.   “Because y’ both black” Sandoval leans forward on his cane and sweeps his palm outwardly, as if to say, ‘there you go’. “For real?!?”, June starts, “Ma-a-a-n , you mean?…awww, here we go, this is how it starts… come on, brother, let’s go…” he steps forward, arm extended as if to bring McNealy with him on his way out.  Once again the bar erupts in laughter. Chuckling, Coach McNealy, picks up his Coke and takes another sip.  The bar returns to its general murmuring. “Pretty lively place!” McNealy says to the bartender. “Well, Coach, you’re kind of a new celebrity around here…a new hire hit’s the old rumor mill pretty hard.” he puts a glass he had been polishing down behind the bar, and looks up, “But y’ see …most everyone in here went to that school…except Kolov.” “You will never know…” the old man’s voice creaks wryly from his perch, somehow having heard the whole conversation. “Well, thanks.” says the coach to the bartender, finishing his soda; he raises his hand in farewell to the bar, “Gentlemen…” “Coach!” comes the response from several voices around the bar. McNealy pivots and pushes through the swinging door in a single motion, without a sound. “That door always makes noise.” says a voice. “The black man is smooth.” counters Avery. “Smooth?  So, what’s your excuse?” says Sandoval teasingly. The door smacks closed with a shudder.(These 2 chapters were written in 2000 and sat unchanged for 7 years until I got it together to write the rest of the story)   ",2017-06-10,"{'Type': 'Individual', 'Members': None, 'Organizer': 'Ted Putnam', 'Beneficiary': None, 'Team name': None, 'Location': 'Madison, WI'}",7,2,56,53,0,0,53,174,"{0: {'Author': 'Ted Putnam', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'I have neglected to thank Anonymous, who has donated multiple times!', 'Photos': [], 'Created_at': '2017-07-28T15:25:30-05:00'}, 1: {'Author': 'Ted Putnam', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'I am almost half way to my goal for &quot;The Mission Higher&quot;!

A sea of hats fills the wide avenue, so far as the eye can see, as thousands march somberly.  Two flat-bed trucks at the head of the procession carry the bodies of the two fallen men, while in the distance a band starts to play Beethoven’s funeral march.  Street cars are abandoned all along this broad arterial avenue.\r\n\r\nThe skies are high and blue.  Strong winds have blown away the fog that normally blankets the city this time of year.  The sounds of flapping banners accompany that of the footfalls of thousands of unionists.  The heads of many marchers are bowed, while some stare straight ahead stoically as they slowly move up the street.  Each man has a union card pinned to his lapel.\r\n\r\nAn unofficial holiday, all businesses seem to have closed and the sidewalks are packed with onlookers.  Children sit astride their parent’s shoulders for a better view of the spectacle.  The city has been abuzz for the last four days in sympathy with the strikers.  The final tally stands at 2 dead and nearly 150 people bruised, beaten and shot.  Nearly anyone in town knows someone who has been affected by recent events.\r\n\r\nBeyond being responsible for both deaths on Bloody Thursday, most people believe that the San Francisco Police have overreacted to the strike, and more to the point, have been the tools of the dock owners in trying to suppress it. They have been warned to stay clear of the proceedings on this day, and are milling about on each and all of the side streets.  The out of town hired muscle that had been brought in by a fleet of tugboats, have, wisely, been spirited back out of town.\r\n\r\nStanding along the curb in front of the Pacific Gas and Electric building is the shoeshine boy, Sandoval.  He clutches his hat as he looks at the ground, his bruised face set in solemnity.  Suddenly, a hand pulls him forward by his upper arm.  Startled, he pulls away before realizing it is June Perry, who has left the column to get him.\r\n\r\nSandoval regains himself and hurries forward to join the procession.  He \r\nbriefly smiles at Guillory, who gathers him in.  Avery claps him on the shoulder and proudly indicates his own lapel.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it something?” Avery Parker says, flashing a smile, “Everyone together!”\r\n\r\nGuillory, who still has his arm around the boy, looks over his shoulder at Avery.  “It’s only too bad that it took two men dyin’ to make it stick.” he says. \r\n\r\nSandoval nods in agreement, but does not speak.  A tear forms in the corner of his eye, perhaps overwhelmed by the culmination of events in this moment.  Sandy dips his head exaggeratedly to hide his emotion, as a gust of wind brings a swell of the marching band’s dirge.\r\n\r\n“Well, we got everybody now.” says June in a hushed voice, surveying the crowd briefly before continuing, “Me an’ Avery finally got to vote… they’re talking about a General Strike.  We’re going to win this thing.  I can feel it.  No more 72 hour shifts!”\r\n\r\n“Amen to that!” says Avery, pulling his beanie higher on his forehead.  He looks skyward, and then speaks under his breath, “Amen to that.”\r\n\r\n', 'Photos': ['https://d2kw0licpa1moo.cloudfront.net/20840568_1498083879.5517_updates.jpg'], 'Created_at': '2017-06-21T17:24:54-05:00'}, 5: {'Author': 'Ted Putnam', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'I&#039;d like to thank  four new  donors!

People of different races, even!  Can you imagine such things?  The  many of the events and Ernest McNealy are real, and the story they tell changed the city and lives of countless others.\r\n\r\nLet me share a different chapter:\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\nTHE SHOT: REVISITING 1934\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is July, 1934.  San Francisco’s largest longshoremen’s strike to date has reached the point of riot.\r\n\r\nSmoke clears to yelling and motion. The Embarcadero is awash in battle.  The huge concrete edifices of the piers dwarf cars, smoke and running men.  Police, their backs to the piers, are launching tear gas canisters as fast as they can.  Men are pouring off Rincon Hill with sticks and rocks in hand, heading for the piers, and, then, retreating in the face of a barrage of gas and rubber dum-dum bullets.\r\n\r\nA younger Guillory has just slipped and twisted his leg on an in-street railroad track, as people flee either side of him.  Suddenly two hands hook him underneath his armpits simultaneously, yanking him up and forward at a dead run\r\n\r\n“Come on, man!” hollers June. He has Guillory under one armpit.\r\n\r\n“Move a muscle!” urges Avery, who has the other.\r\n\r\nAs the three men vacate the spot on the tracks on five legs, another man runs through, and is forced forward with a thud and a bullet.  The man goes limp immediately, stone dead.  Two steps away, the three men hit the ground in response to the shot, and look back.\r\n\r\n“Bordois!” yells Avery in horror, and starts back to the fallen man.  Guillory grabs his jacket.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing to be done, mister.  He’s gone!” Guillory says emphatically.\r\n\r\nAvery re-hooks Guillory, and the three men amble towards an overturned vegetable truck.  They dive behind the up-turned flat bed, wisps of gas flowing by on the stiff wind.\r\n\r\n“Did you see that?  They’re shooting live rounds back there!” says June, obviously alarmed.\r\n\r\n“I knew him from the Strike kitchen…” Avery yells, his voice trails off as he cranes his neck and head back to the dead man.  The din of the conflict is deafening.  Then he turns his head back to the other two, “…and I liked him! Why’d we help this peckerwood?” he continues.\r\n\r\n“On reflex.” says June, simply.  He rises slightly to peer over the wooden bed of the truck.\r\n\r\n“Damn-yesterday we couldn’t even vote down at the hall…” Avery states indignantly.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t even there, gentlemen.” says Guillory, defensively, “I’ve got no problem with your kind…but do you think we could take this up at another time?”\r\n\r\n“You damn right we gonna take it up!” demands June.  Then, noticing Guillory trying to stretch out his leg, “How‘s that peg?”  \r\n\r\n“Twisted it a bit.” says Guillory, wincing, “She’ll be fine…say, I…”\r\n\r\n“Save it!” yells Avery, who had been looking around the end of the truck.\r\n\r\nJune rises up again to look back to the action.  His eyes follow Avery’s pointing finger to a skinny teenager with a shoeshine box flying through the air as he flails his arms in protection from a mounted policeman clubbing him.\r\n\r\n“Sandoval!  Over here!  Sandoval!” yell the two men.\r\n\r\n', 'Photos': [], 'Created_at': '2017-06-15T00:00:07-05:00'}, 6: {'Author': 'Ted Putnam', 'Author type': 'ORGANIZER', 'Text': 'Check out this vintage short movie about Youth Gangs appearing in my book  in &#039;61 San Francisco.

Since then, my darling granddaughter has endured constant pain in her legs. She can take oral medications but try's to minimize their use so that she can make it to school without her brain being compromised. So, on June 12th, she is going to repeat the pump placement surgery. (Brave girl) Whatever help we can get for her and her family (prayers included please) would be appreciated.

Their only access to formal employment is for companies to hire them and issue a work visa. Large companies need to make a commitment to make these hires. Refugees need to work in order to support themselves and their families. They  deserve to live with dignity.I am starting a Corporate Social Responsibility Campaign to help my friend Mohamed (pictured below with his brother who recently arrived in Turkey from Syria). He created a  non-profit website for Syrian refugees, like himself, to find jobs. Ejad Jobs for Refugees Now we need to get employers to post jobs through the website and commit to hiring refugees. While he updates the website, I am doing market research to identify every company to involve in this campaign. I will let them know there is a demand for them to do their part, and that it will help their company's profitability. I will ask them to hire as many refugees as they legally can (1 in 5 hires).I am doing this work pro bono for Mohamed and his  community of Syrian refugees. Funding will be needed to pay my travel expenses, salary and incidental expenses. Mohamed and his brother should be paid for the website creation and maintenance. I will give him the funds when I get to Turkey in August. Beyond that I will use any additional funds to payTurkish nationals to market to smaller companies, especially throughout the southern region where refugees enter the country.  This will increase the scale of the operation, leading to more potential hires, which is our goal.No one else is doing this work, so we need all the help we can get.

Over two decades, the treatment center has served nearly 5,000 clients through an intensive 28-day residential program and additional outpatient services.In 2016, Steve recruited leaders from (and friends of) the recovery community to establish The Harrison House Foundation - a non-profit independent of Harrison House - ""to provide support to individuals who are battling against their addictions, regardless of financial circumstances"". The Foundation provides scholarships for at-risk clients who are unable to pay for treatment. Harrison House makes a 2:1 match for each dollar donated to the Foundation for services. (The cost for the residential program is $270/day, or roughly $7,500/28 days.)The Foundation has also launched a community awareness campaign through its quarterly speaker series. In the first installment on Saturday March 4th, Steve (pictured, above) gave an oral history of his work and welcomed two Harrison House graduates to share their stories. Future speakers will include local medical professionals, law enforcement/EMS personnel, and other community members and leaders who can assist in educating and furthering the cause to treat substance abuse. In remembrance of our dear friend Steve Crow, Harrison House Foundation is pleased to announce the Steve Crow Memorial Scholarship through which we will continue Steve’s mission to assist people recovering from substance abuse.

Zahmir is a fun, loving, and happy fifteen year old teen, in many ways like any other his age. He loves swimming, music, & spending time with his friends and family after school. 

But unlike his neurotypical peers, Zahmir struggles with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs his ability to communicate and interact with others. It affects him physically, cognitively, and emotionally. So while he enjoys the same things in life as everyone else, his experiences are VERY different. 

Autism causes Zahmir to have limited verbal skills and he requires assistance with his day to day activities. In order to make his day to day an easier, and to allow him to some day become independent, we would like to enroll him in Homotoxicology therapy. 

Homotoxicology studies the influences of toxic substances in humans where symptoms and disease are seen as a result of the appropriate biological resistance to toxic substances. Homotoxicology utilizes cellular drainage, nutrition, and time-tested homeopathic techniques to stimulate the self-healing mechanism in children. It is a therapy geared to enable children to move to the next level of health. 

Zahmir will benefit from this because the therapy can help him advance his verbal skills, his understanding of every day tasks, and hopefully, will allow him to express himself fluently! 

We are asking for your help to raise funds to assist in helping Zahmir take part in these sessions that are essentially life changing. 

The breakdown of the cost are as follow:
- the initial consultation: $395.00
- sessions every six weeks: $195.00
- products purchases every 6 weeks: $250.00 

On behalf of my entire family, I thank you, our supporters, our village for your support past and present!❤
